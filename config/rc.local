# Ubuntu 14.04 have Transparent Huge Pages (THP) support enabled by default in
# its kernel. This will create latency and memory usage issues with Redis. To
# fix this issue run the command 'echo never >
# /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' as root, and add it to the
# /etc/rc.local in order to retain the setting after a reboot. Redis must be
# restarted after THP is disabled.
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
exit 0
